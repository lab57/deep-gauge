    "In perspective transform, we try to project image from a different point of view. For this, the position of object should be known in advance. Merely calculating perspective transform without knowing the position of the object can lead to degradation of the dataset. Hence, this type of augmentation has to be performed selectively. The greatest advantage with this augmentation is that it can emphasize on parts of object in image which the network needs to learn."
